# pyfem
Python's implementation of the Finite Element Method

Objective is development of Python's modules for the FEM analysis.
This project is started as a background for a series articles and a book (monograph or tutorial) that will be written and published further.

Core modules are placed in main folder of the project.
Examples are placed in the subdirectory "examples".
